# fuzzy_structural_classification


## ReadMe

Implementation of fuzzy logic on a
problem of classification of the physical condition
of structures such as houses, structures, etc. using simpful library.

## What it does

This implementation takes 11 parameters: P1, P2, P3, ...., P11, each one representing the state of different aspects of the property to evaluate.
Based on the input of this 11 parameters, a fuzzy logic methodology is applied to classify the state of the property in one of five classes: IC_C, 
IC_Inad, IC_Insf, IC_Suf and finally IC_Exc.
